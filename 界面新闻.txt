For example, if you use Huawei's built-in app store function to download an app, we will only use Huawei's official platform service to complete the function. Other mobile phone brands include Xiaomi, OPPO, and VIVO. If other brands or mobile phone brands mentioned above use unofficial app store download interface apps, we will complete this function through service provider push. The implementation of this feature requires the collection of your personal information, device information, and application list information to ensure the uniqueness, accuracy, and effectiveness of the push.
At the same time, to ensure accurate delivery of messages, there will be application self startup and associated startup behavior after the application exits, which is implemented by individual push providers and various push provider channels.

1.3. Network information (see "Definition: Network Information" for details) and location related information: In order to maintain the stability of network connections and establish long links to the greatest extent possible, we need to understand the network status and changes of devices, so as to achieve stable and continuous push services.

We can recommend push content that better meets your needs and reduce unnecessary push messages that disturb you.
